## Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Visualizer and Controller | 2024

This project implements a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm through an interactive C# interface.
It allows the user to configure core parameters such as:

⭐ Number of particles (N)

⭐ Number of generations (G)

⭐ Cognitive coefficient (C1)

⭐ Social coefficient (C2)

The system supports multiple termination criteria — Generation count, Epsilon threshold, or Convergence detection.
During execution, the program visualizes the Gbest Convergence Graph, displaying how the swarm collectively approaches the global optimum.
The final output shows the minimum objective function value (Min Obj) obtained through iterative global best updates.
